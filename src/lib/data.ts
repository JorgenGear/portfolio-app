The system analyzes multiple financial metrics including price, dividend yield, P/E ratio, earnings per share, and other key indicators to identify natural groupings of similar stocks.

The analysis process involves data preprocessing, feature normalization using Z-score transformation, and determining the optimal number of clusters through the Elbow method and Knee Locator algorithm. The system successfully identified five distinct stock clusters, each with unique investment characteristics and risk-return profiles.

Key findings include the identification of high-value stable performers, growth stocks, and value investment opportunities. The analysis provides actionable insights for portfolio diversification and investment strategy optimization.`,
